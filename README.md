 Performance Measure
For regression problems you have a couple of performance measures you can pick including:

MAE - Mean Absolute Error. this does not penalize large errors
MSE - Mean Squared Error. this penalizes large errors
RMSE - Root Mean Squared Error. this penalizes large errors
R2 - Measures the strength of the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variables by measuring the part of the variance of the dependent variable explained by the independent variable.
RMSLE - Root Mean squared Log Error
MAPE - Mean absolute Percentage Error
